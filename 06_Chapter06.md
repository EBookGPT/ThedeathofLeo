# Chapter 6: Autopsy Report

The death of Leo had shaken the entire kingdom to its core. The mere thought of a 6-year-old child being killed in an archery duel was enough to make even the most battle-hardened knights shudder. 

As the investigation deepened, and the suspects and motives were uncovered, it was time to dissect the truth behind Leo's death. The autopsy report would reveal the gruesome details that nobody wanted to hear, but everyone needed to know. 

The report indicated that Leo had been wounded multiple times by arrows, each piercing his young skin with brutal force. The cause of death was ultimately determined to be massive blood loss from the wounds inflicted by the arrows. 

It was a horrifying revelation, and everyone involved in the investigation was left reeling from the trauma of it all. Nonetheless, the autopsy report was a necessary piece of evidence that would help the investigators solve this heinous crime. 

As the kingdom held its breath awaiting justice for Leo, the investigators knew that they still had much work ahead of them. But with the autopsy report in hand, they were one step closer to finding the truth behind the death of the innocent child.
# Chapter 6: Autopsy Report - Robin Hood's Tale

Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men had learned of the death of Leo, and they were devastated by what had happened. A young child, killed in such a brutal fashion – it was an injustice that they simply could not ignore. 

As they began to investigate, they discovered that the autopsy report had revealed a devastating truth – Leo had been wounded multiple times by arrows, each piercing his young skin with brutal force. The cause of death was ultimately determined to be massive blood loss from the wounds inflicted by the arrows.

Robin knew that they now had the evidence they needed to prove who was responsible for Leo's death. He called a meeting of his team and laid out the facts. 

"It is clear from the autopsy report that Leo was killed by the arrows that were fired at him. We must find out who fired those arrows and bring them to justice."

The Merry Men nodded their agreement, and they began to form a plan. They knew that they could not rest until they found the person responsible for this heinous crime. 

Through their investigations, Robin and his team were able to collect several arrowheads from the scene of the crime. They also gathered information about the suspects and their respective motives. 

As they sorted through their evidence, it became clear that there was one person who had the means and motive to commit the crime – a prominent noble who had been openly jealous of Leo's family. 

Robin and his team stealthily made their way to the noble's estate, determined to uncover the truth. They found the noble and presented their evidence, accusing him of the crime. 

To their surprise, the noble broke down and confessed to the crime, admitting that he had taken his jealousy too far and was the one who fired the fatal arrow. 

Justice had been served, and Robin and his band of Merry Men were able to bring peace to Leo's family and honor his memory. The autopsy report was the final piece of evidence that they needed to prove who was responsible for this heinous crime, and they were grateful for its help in bringing the perpetrator to justice.
# Code Explanation:

To solve the Robin Hood story, Robin and his team needed to gather evidence and analyze it in order to identify the perpetrator of the crime. Here's how they did it:

## 1. Collection and Analysis of Arrowheads:

The Merry Men collected several arrowheads from the scene of the crime, and they then analyzed them to determine who they belonged to. This was done by carefully examining the design of each arrowhead and comparing it to known designs from the surrounding area.

```python
arrowheads = ["Arrowhead 1", "Arrowhead 2", "Arrowhead 3", "Arrowhead 4", "Arrowhead 5"]

for arrowhead in arrowheads:
    if arrowhead in known_designs:
        print("This arrowhead belongs to a member of the nobleman's army.")
    else:
        print("This arrowhead belongs to a member of the commoners' army.")
```

## 2. Investigation of Suspects and Motives:

The team also investigated the suspects and their motives by gathering information from witnesses and other sources. This allowed them to eliminate some suspects and focus their investigation on others.

```python
suspects = {"Nobleman": "Jealous of Leo's family", "Commoner": "No motive found", "Knight": "Personal vendetta against Leo's family"}

for suspect, motive in suspects.items():
    if motive == "No motive found":
        print(f"{suspect} has been ruled out as a suspect.")
    else:
        print(f"{suspect} is a suspect with the following motive: {motive}.")
```

## 3. Confrontation and Confession:

Finally, the team used their evidence to confront the nobleman and accuse him of the crime. They presented him with the arrowheads and other evidence, and the nobleman eventually broke down and confessed to the crime.

```python
def confront_suspect(suspect):
    if suspect == "Nobleman":
        print("We have evidence linking you to Leo's death. You fired the fatal arrow, didn't you?")
        confession = input("Did you kill Leo? (Yes/No) ")
        if confession == "Yes":
            print("The nobleman has confessed. We have solved the crime!")
        else:
            print("Continue the investigation.")
    else:
        print("You are not a suspect in this case.")
```

Through the collection and analysis of arrowheads, investigation of suspects and motives, and confrontation and confession, Robin and his team were able to solve the crime and bring the perpetrator to justice. The code samples above demonstrate how their investigation relied on a combination of evidence gathering, analysis, and intuition to solve the case.
