# Chapter 3: Discovery of Leo's Death

The sun was setting behind the thick forest trees of Sherwood, casting long shadows across the woodland floor. The sounds of wildlife were slowly starting to fade into the distance, only to be replaced by the faint creaking of bowstrings and the eerie whistling of arrows cutting through the air.

Robin Hood and his merry men were deep in the heart of their beloved sanctuary, with bows armed and senses heightened. The enemy was near, and they needed to be alert if they wanted to spot them before it was too late.

But amidst all this tension, one of the young boys ran up to Robin Hood with tears in his eyes. He had found a body, he said, and it was that of the young boy who had so often played amongst the Merry Men - Leo.

Robin Hood's heart sank. He knew that Leo was a brave young boy, someone who had always been full of life and energy. To see him lying lifeless in the dirt was nothing short of heartbreaking.

But Robin Hood knew that he had to keep a level head. He needed to find out who had done this to Leo, and make sure that justice was served. And so, with heavy hearts, the Merry Men set out to find the killer - whoever they may be. 

```python
# Code Sample - Search for the Killer
def search_for_killer():
  suspects = ["Prince John", "Sheriff of Nottingham", "Sir Guy of Gisborne", "Random hunter"]
  for suspect in suspects:
    if suspect == "Random hunter":
      print("Found the killer - the random hunter")
      return
  print("No clear evidence, let's investigate further")
```
# Chapter 3: Discovery of Leo's Death

As Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men scoured the forest in search of clues, their hearts were heavy with sorrow for the loss of Leo. The young boy had always been a beacon of hope and light in their underground world, bringing smiles to even the most hardened of their band.

But as they searched for clues, their sorrow quickly turned to anger. Who could be so heartless as to take the life of a 6-year-old child in an archery duel? Was it Prince John, the cruel ruler who had made their lives a living hell since the day he took control? Or was it the Sheriff of Nottingham, the man who had personally led the assault on their hideout just months before?

The tension in the camp was palpable as the merry men debated their next steps. They knew that if they didn't solve this mystery and bring Leo's killer to justice, the senselessness of his death would only be compounded.

Robin Hood stepped forward, his face set in determination. "We will not rest until we find the person responsible for this heinous act. We will hunt them down, and they will pay for what they have done."

And with those words, the Merry Men set out once again, combing the woods for any sign of their enemy. It was a dangerous game they played, knowing that the killer could be anyone - even a member of their own ranks.

As they searched, Robin Hood's mind worked overtime, trying to piece together the motives behind Leo's murder. Was it a random act of violence, a sick game played by a hunter who had stumbled upon their hiding spot? Or was it something more sinister, a carefully planned attack meant to strike fear into the hearts of the Merry Men?

It wasn't until they stumbled upon a broken arrow, the tip stained with blood, that they knew they were on the right track. Someone had used foul play to take Leo's life, and they would stop at nothing until they found out who. 

```python
# Code Sample - Investigate the Evidence
def investigate_evidence():
  broken_arrow = True
  blood_stain = True
  if broken_arrow and blood_stain:
    print("The killer used a broken arrow, and there is blood on the tip. We must analyze this further.")
    return
  print("No clear evidence, let's investigate other areas.")
```
# Explanation of Code Sample

In order to solve the mystery of Leo's death, the Merry Men needed to carefully investigate the evidence they had found. The first step was to identify any clear leads that they could follow up on.

The `search_for_killer()` function represents this stage of the investigation. The Merry Men had compiled a list of potential suspects, and they needed to work through them systematically to figure out who had killed Leo. By looping through the list of suspects and checking each one individually, they were able to identify the random hunter as the killer and bring him to justice.

The second stage of the investigation involved analyzing any evidence that was found at the scene of the crime. The `investigate_evidence()` function represents this part of the process. By checking for broken arrows and blood stains, the Merry Men were able to identify a key piece of evidence that would help them to narrow down the list of suspects and focus their investigation on finding the killer.

Overall, these functions demonstrate the importance of working systematically and carefully when trying to solve a mystery. By following a clear process for gathering and analyzing evidence, the Merry Men were able to identify the person responsible for Leo's death and bring them to justice.
